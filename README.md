# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

For our final project, we (Beatriz Santos and Nicole Zajac) designed a text-based adventure game. The theme is "escape the jail cell", meaning that players will read the descriptions and are asked to make decisions in order to hopefully escape and win the game. Throughout the game there are many possibilities to gain or lose health, which means players have to think carefully and be mindful of their health in order not to lose!
